#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)
`The loop will run until it hits n^3, so it varys on the number of items in a list`


b) O(n log n)
`The outside loop runs n times, the inner loops runs at log(n). The sum counts how many times j is being doubled "j *= 2." This means that j would increment exponentially until it reaches n.`


c) O(n)
`Varys on the size of the input. If you were to input 4 for bunnies, the operation would run until bunnies is at zero`
